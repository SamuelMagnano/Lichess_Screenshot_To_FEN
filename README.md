# Lichess_Screenshot_To_FEN
 Developing a CNN to recognize lichess pieces from a screenshot and create the related FEN, since many puzzle/opening/training videos on youtube do not include it nor the PNG. 
 
The goal is to build a model strong enough to recognize all the pieces from various pieces set, in order to evaluate a position without having to recreate it manually using the board editor.
